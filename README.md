# FizzBuzz
This PHP code prints out a list of numbers up to the specified limit. But for multiples of three it prints “Fizz” beside the number and for the multiples of five it prints “Buzz” beside the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints “FizzBuzz” beside the number.

You can see this code in action <a href="http://www.conorwalsh.net/algorithms/fizzbuzz/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this project I hope that it is of use to you,<br/>
